     ```

ðŸ“– Solution Format

Each solution file follows a consistent format:
	â€¢	Problem Name: Title of the problem.
	â€¢	Problem Description: A short summary of the problem.
	â€¢	Approach: Explanation of the solution approach.
	â€¢	Complexity: Analysis of time and space complexity.
	â€¢	Code: Optimized Python solution.

ðŸ§© Example

File: Solution.py

```python
# Problem: Contains Duplicate
# Description: Check if a list contains any duplicates.
# Approach:
# 1. Use a set to track unique elements (O(1) for lookup/insertion).
# 2. Iterate through the list:
#    - If an element exists in the set, return True (duplicate found).
#    - Otherwise, add the element to the set.
# 3. If no duplicates are found after iteration, return False.
# Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n).

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        unique_nums = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in unique_nums:
                return True
            unique_nums.add(num)
        return False
```
